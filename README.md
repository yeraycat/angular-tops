# angular-tops
Rankings web application made using Angular.

Tops is a web application to rank other websites by user votes. Is a didactic project and the aim is to implement the same application with different technologies (angular, react, vanilla js, node backend, python backend...).

The ranking is a simple concept so its a good use case make a practice project in a new technology. It also allows to iterate over it and add some complexity to the concept, such as rules for voting, allowing users to add their own websites to the ranking...

This is the first implementation of the Tops project, and it is by using Angular.
